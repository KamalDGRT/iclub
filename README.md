## Problem Statement & Solution proposed

_It is often the case that students are not able to access their attendance at all and often have to rely on third-party apps to manually track their attendance. In cases of online lectures/meetings, they donâ€™t have a portal where they can track their schedule of the same. Club-related information are often scarce, and there is no one place to go to get to know the clubs of the college._

_By having a single place to access all of the above (and not limited to those features), the portal helps each student simplify their college life._

### The Q & A's
**Q ) How will or has the solution improved the lives of people in the community?**

**A )** *Easy access to information otherwise informally shared through social media platforms. College-going students are the primary users of this portal. Colleges, if interested, can use our solution for their students to easily get access to information like timetables and club activities without having to rely on a single person to share it via social media.*

**Q ) What were the steps taken to test this solution?**

**A )** _We hosted the portal on a free hosting provider 000webhost to share it with our classmates in order to log in, test our solution, and get feedback on it. When we receive any feedback, we evaluated it internally within our team and decided to take it or not depending on a variety of factors like usefulness, impact, and feasibility._

**Q ) What do you see as the future / next steps for your project? What will take your project to the next level? What specific support do you need to achieve that?**

**A )** _We can expand to other colleges in the country, and potentially go global as well. Colleges can adapt this solution to manage their administrative affairs, student activities, and specific solutions like attendance tracking._

_Implementing the same using Flutter Toolkit in order to have a single codebase is also up for discussion._

_A good web hosting platform to host this portal._
